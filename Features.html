	<ul>
		<li>﻿﻿Entirely web-based﻿﻿. Runs on any web-server that can accommodate PHP - can use a professionally managed server of an ISP instead of having to purchase and maintain own server</li>
		<li>﻿﻿Produces reports to Portable Document Format - PDF for accurate positioning of text﻿﻿ ﻿﻿All reports and scripts follow the same conventions for consistent and modifiable PHP scripts, easily followable by business people.﻿﻿ ﻿</li>
		<li>All processing is on the web-server with no installation required on client PCs - only a browser and a PDF reader is required.﻿﻿ ﻿</li>
		<li>Multi-language - each user can see the interface in their preferred language - 37 translations are available and bundled with the system.﻿</li>
		<li>﻿﻿Numbers are displayed appropriately for the language selected and input is allowed in this format.﻿﻿</li>
		<li>﻿﻿Fully utf-8 compliant. PDF reports produced using adobe CIF fonts for lightweight PDFs using utf-8 character set for any language.﻿﻿</li>
		<li>﻿Multi-theme - each user can see the interface in their preferred graphical theme. A choice of 9 themes are available and bundled with the system.﻿﻿</li>
		<li>Can be integrated with a wiki (any wakka fork) to hold narrative on items, suppliers and customers. e.g. The wiki may contain any information particular to the customer with links to say credit history - call log for customer services/sales/accounts etc﻿﻿</li>
		<li>The underlying code of the system is written in a way so as to maximise it's readability for those new to PHP coding. The idea being that business users will be able to administer and adapt the system to exactly suit their needs.</li>

		<li>﻿﻿Pages can be encrypted using SSL and webERP can be configured to only display pages using SSL to ensure that all information passing over the internet is encrypted.﻿﻿</li>
		<li>﻿﻿Users can be defined to see only certain modules on the main menu - so menu options that they will not have access to are not even displayed on screen.﻿﻿</li>
		<li>﻿﻿HTTP security can be configured over the top of the inbuilt security to provide two levels of security - the first to access the web-server at all and the second to actually get into webERP﻿﻿</li>
		<li>﻿﻿An audit trail of which users did what is retained and is automatically maintained based on how long the information is required to be kept﻿﻿</li>
		<li>﻿﻿All inputs are sanitised to prevent SQL injections and cross site scripting.﻿﻿</li>
