				<ul>
					<li>Entirely web-based. Can be used on any web server that supports PHP. Use your own server or a managed server from an ISP to avoid purchase and maintenance costs.</li>
					<li>All processing is done on the web server. No software is required to access webERP other than a recent web browser (and optionally a PDF reader).</li>
					<li>webERP scripts are written to maximise readability for business users so they can customize webERP for unique needs. Scripts follow webERP coding standards for consistency, clarity and ease of customizing.</li>
					<li>Produces PDF reports for accurately positioned text. Report scripts follow webERP coding standards for consistency, clarity and ease of customizing.</li>
					<li>Multi-language - users can select their own preferred language from the 37 languages currently available.</li>
					<li>Numbers are displayed appropriately for the selected language (input also uses the selected language).</li>
					<li>Fully UTF-8 compliant. PDF reports use Adobe CIF fonts for small file sizes using UTF-8 character sets for any language.</li>
					<li>Multi-theme - users can select the display theme from the 9 themes currently available.</li>
					<li>Items, Suppliers and Customers have optional Wiki integration for storing related notes. For example, notes on Item use or approved OEMs, Supplier account information or detailed contact information, or Customer credit history or contact history for service, sales and payments.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Sales people logins can be defined limiting these users to see only their own customer accounts and orders.</li>
					<li>Attempting to login with an incorect password three times locks the user account to prevent brute-force password cracking (only a webERP administrator can unlock an account).</li>
					<li>All communication over the internet can be encrypted using SSL to prevent evesdropping on a connection.</li>
					<li>Users can be defined to see only certain modules on the main menu - so menu options that they will not have access to are not even displayed on screen.</li>
					<li>HTTP security can be configured over the top of the inbuilt security to provide two levels of security - the first to access the web-server at all and the second to actually get into webERP.</li>
					<li>An audit trail is kept of every transaction or data entry and the user that performed it.</li>
					<li>All data is sanitised to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting.</li>
